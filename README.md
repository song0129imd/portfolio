#### How Did I Create my Portfolio

I created my portfolio based on the projects I did during the first two semesters. There are three main projects that I focus. The first one is about UX design. It is about one of my favorite bubble tea shop Website Redesign Project. The second one is about Content Management System. I created and managed the content about a Yoga Studio. The third one I would like to demonstrate my ability of coding in HTML and CSS. 

I also add my personal background information. Because of my unique cultural and academic background. I am sure I will be a strong candidate who can multi-task and communicate effectively in the workplace. 

###### My Challenges during Development

Bootstrap is relatively a new concept for me. Therefore, it is challenging for me to use it comfortably at the beginning. After reviewing the course material and class recording, I find bootstrap is very useful and powerful. 

###### What I learned after creating this Portfolio

I learned a lot about bootstrap. I also go back to the material to review accessibility standards. I try to use wave to detect one of my buttons that have low contrast. I was able to fix it. After reviewing the material, I find accessibility is a very important subject that needs people to continue to work on it. As at the end of the day, developers wants to make their users use the website more convienently.
